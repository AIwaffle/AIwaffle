# Intro To Machine Learning

Welcome to the first course on machine learning by AIwaffle.
This course intended to give you basic sense about the practical advantages of ML, and make you understand the concept behind the ML technology.

Most terminologies will be explained with their first appearance. 
You can also check the [ML glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) provided by google.

## What is Machine Learning?
> "A computer program is said to learn from experience _E_ with respect to some class of tasks _T_ and performance measure _P_ if its performance at tasks in _T_, as measured by _P_, improves with experience _E_." 
> --*Tom M. Mitchell*

The concept of machine learning has a long history. However, it does not until recently becomes widespread. We will not say more of the history of ML, do the favor for yourself if you are interested.

We suppose you have learnt at least one programming language, and you must know that most traditional programs has a static logic. For example, *if* some condition, *do* this, *else*, *do* that... In other words, you will have the same output give the same input (this is not necessarily false in ML, but the point is, in non-ML programs, it won't change as time goes on). Even after making thousand times the same mistake, the program will keep going wrong until you fixed that.

Machine learning provided a way to *learn* things from *data*. It saved us from designing logic to solve the problem, so we can just ignore the intricacies in the problem and stop messing up more with our pathetic brains. Like, how can you make a program to recognize cat in images with *ifs* and *elses*?

## What can you learn from the course?
The course is aimed at AI starters. It will give you three benefits:
1. Save your time from programming. The ML models can release you from designing logics and bugs.
2. Let you reuse your code. Most ML models are capable in a wide range of tasks. For example, you can transport an image classifier to a facial recognition system real quick. See [Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning)
3. Solve seemingly "unprogrammable" or fun tasks. For instance, a cat recognizer, a 60% win-rate paper scissor rock AI player, or a [Tetris AI](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/xkcd/deeprl-tetris).
