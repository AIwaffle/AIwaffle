We can add and subtract matrices of the same size, multiply one matrix with another as long as the sizes are compatible ((n × m) × (m × p) = n × p), and multiply an entire matrix by a constant. A vector is a matrix with just one row or column.  \n![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/28/zQqZ7EKkaPAsGl1.png)\n\n## Tensor\nA [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) is the basic data structure in ML.  \nA tensor is often thought of as a generalized matrix. That is, it could be a 1D matrix (a vector is such a tensor), a 3D matrix (a cube of numbers), even a 0D matrix (a single number), or a higher dimensional structure that is harder to visualize. The dimension of the tensor is called its rank.  \n\nThis is a example of a 3D tensor\n![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/28/GTzKjnQJO5LB1ds.png)  "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's try to do some tensor manuver with the popular ML library: Pytorch"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating a tensor\n1.
