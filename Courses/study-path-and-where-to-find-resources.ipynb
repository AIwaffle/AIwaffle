Personally I believe AI technology will start a technology revolution and totally revamp the world as well as our lives.\nThe definition of AI is broad, in AIwaffle Courses, *AI*, *Machine Learning*, *Deep Learning* means similar things, since deep learning is the mostly focused subfield in ML, which is the basis of AI technology.\nTo get started in Machine Learning, there is some basic skills you should acquire.  \n## Python\nIf you don't know what is this, why are you reading? Go learn it first!\n## Linear Algebra: vectors, matrix multiplication\nThe AIwaffle Courses only require a subset of linear algebra.  \nIf you know vectors and matrix multiplication, you are good to go.  \n\nUseful resources:  \nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra  \nhttps://brilliant.org/wiki/matrices/  \n## Calculus: partial derivitives, gradients\nThat's all you need for now.  \n\nUseful resources:  \nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus  \nhttps://brilliant.org/wiki/partial-derivatives/\n## Libraries for ML\n**Must**: [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)  \nGraphing library like: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or its high-level API [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) or others.  \n\nRemember: You don't have to be proficient at them.  \nThe AIwaffle Courses will also lead you through Pytorch. The best is: if you are good at self-studying, skip AIwaffle Course 2-7 by going to pytorch.org\n## Other Useful Resources\nVideos from 3b1b - Make sure to watch them before you start an AIwaffle Course! These videos give you an intuitive understanding on *Neural Networks* and *Deep Learning*.  \n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) | [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/88461692/channel/detail?cid=26587)\n\n[Google Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/) for you geeks\n\n[A lot of ML Cheat Sheets](https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-science-pdf-f22dc900d2d7): Most of them are useless. Use at your own risk.\n\n## Where to ask questions\nCreate an issue in our [Github repo](https://github.com/AIwaffle/AIwaffle)  \nAsk in our Forum: TBD  \nSend an email to lunw1024@gmail.com  \n\nEnough talk, jump into the next AIwaffle Course **Pytorch: Tensor Manipulation** to get your hands dirty!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
